    <h2>Far Cry 1</h2>
    <p>*Far Cry* is a first-person shooter developed by Crytek and published by Ubisoft, released in 2004 for Microsoft Windows. 
        The game follows Jack Carver, a former Special Forces operative, stranded on a mysterious tropical archipelago. 
        Tasked with rescuing a journalist, players navigate open-ended environments, engaging in stealth and combat against 
        mercenaries and mutated creatures. Notable for its advanced CryEngine, the game features stunning visuals, dynamic AI, 
        and non-linear gameplay. It received critical acclaim for its graphics and freedom of approach, though some criticized 
        its story and difficulty spikes. *Far Cry* established the foundation for the popular franchise, with later ports to consoles as *Far Cry Instincts*.</p>
    
    <h2>Campaign</h2>
    <p>Far Cry's campaign is set on a fictional tropical archipelago, where Jack Carver, a former military man now working as a boatman, 
    is hired to escort journalist Val Cortez. After an attack on his boat, 
    Jack is shipwrecked on an island and discovers a plan involving genetic experiments conducted by scientist 
    Dr. Krieger. The narrative unfolds across 20 levels, combining exploration, stealth, and combat in varied 
    environments such as jungles, beaches, military installations, and volcanoes. The campaign is known for its 
    tactical freedom, allowing for stealthy or aggressive approaches, but has been criticized for a generic story 
    and difficulty spikes, especially against mutant enemies.</p>
